# Push swap
### Logic flow
1. Check if there are invalid characters, nbr too big for int, or duplicates
2. Create linked list structure? 
3. Take arguments and put them in a linked list A as integers (first item at the top). Possibly divide into more lists if nbr of arguments > X.
4. Create a function for each operation possible
5. Measure cost of sorting each number
6. Create list B
