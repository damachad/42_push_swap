# Push swap
### Logic flow
1. Check if there are invalid characters, nbr too big for int, or duplicates
2. Create linked list structure?
3. Take arguments and put them in a linked list A as integers (first item at the top).
4. Check if numbers are already sorted
5. Create a function for each operation possible
6. Create list B
7. (Create testing function to print lists)
8. Create function to return size of list
9. Measure cost of sorting each number
10. Create different sorting functions, depending on the number of elements to sort
